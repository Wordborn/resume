<h1>About me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
    Born and bred in the city of Ibadan, I grew up to become a myriad of many worlds.
    First, growing up seemed like I was in Alcatraz; I was so protected. That eventually turned me into an introvert. So I am your stay at home genius; yeah, I love the indoors.

    Did I ever mention to you that I am an artist? Well if I didn't - now you know. I remember back in primary school, I made my first comic. I think it was about Ninja Turtles. I gave it out to a friend - Timi, do you still have that comic, Lol.

    That was number two; you were not waiting for me to say that, were you? (naughty face)
    he stage! Something kept drawing me to the stage; I started by acting in a French Drama, then to secondary school choir... well I continued till university and possibly till now there's still that pull, that tug at the hem of my clothes towards everyting called "stage"

    There is an Author in me, you have seen him before. He started Darkness at Niella, Heaven's seal, Heartbeats and many others. I know I should have given you a good piece; edited them and presented them as a book or something. I promise, you'll have it soon.
